x  Create a Node/Express server app.
x  This app should actively listen for requests on port 3000.
x  It should be able to serve back our static files (index.html, any js or css files)
x  as well as handle incoming requests to any routes.
x  Include a routing module to use with your Ajax requests.

x  Our application needs to be able to input new animals
x  and display current animals.
x  This will require Ajax requests to send data to the server
x  and Ajax requests to retrieve data from the server.

x  When a new kind of animal is entered from the user, use the randomNumber function below to get a number between 1 and 100.
Use this number as your number of animals value in the database for this entry.

Random number function: function randomNumber(min, max){ return Math.floor(Math.random() * (1 + max - min) + min); }
This function could be wrapped in a custom module (hint hint).

// Tried to make this into a module and require it in app.js but couldn't figure out how to do this in app.js so
didn't wrap into a custom module. Just created it as function in client side and called it.


x  The app should display all animals listed in our database when it loads
!!! and after each animal group is added.
